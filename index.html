            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Avril, a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) with interest in Economics.
                I am also under the NUS Merit Scholarship.</p>
                <p>As someone that enjoys pushing my own limits, I am always willing to take on any challenges that might be posed to me, even it is something
                    I have minimal experience in. This has had led me to source for and embark on interesting projects both in and out of school, and a chance to explore
                    what I am truly passionate about. From a young age, I have always been curious about the world, and this has led me to read a myriad of books on any 
                    and every topic that catches my attention.</p>
                    <p>Aside from academics, I also find immense joy in giving back to the community. This motivated me to join various volunteering groups that serve
                        different groups of beneficiaries.</p>
                        <p>To me, personal branding is exceptionally critical, especially in this competitive world. I am an individual that does everything with my
                            absolute best, making sure I produce the best possible results. This is reflected in both my academic pursits and my extracurricular activities.</p>

                <h3>Maybank Data Science and Analytics Intern</h3>
                <p>I worked together with the Data Analytics team under the Strategy department at Maybank Singapore.
                    My job scope included analysing the traffic flow and customer movements on the Maybank website and application.</p>
                    <p>Some of the skills I acquired during the course of this internship include using Google Analytics, Google BigQuery, Firebase,
                        MicroSoft Excel, and SQL. </p>

                <h3>Public Health Screening Website (ONGOING)</h3>
                <p>Together with a 4 other Computer Science students, we collaborated with NUS School of Medicine to develop a website 
                    for their annual public health screening. This significantly aided the health care workers and volunteers on the day of the event 
                    in facilitating the process of the health screening. Furthermore, we developed a queuing system to make the screening process more
                    efficient.</p>
                    <p>Some of the skills I acquired and further developed during the course of this project include using non-SQL databases like MongoDB. I
                        also honed my abilities in HTML and CSS.</p>
